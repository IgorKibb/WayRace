         <h3 class="titleArticle">Stopwatch and Pomodoro: Tools for More Effective Study and Work</h3>
         <p>Stopwatch and Pomodoro are two tools that can be used to improve study and work performance.
            Stopwatch is a time-measuring device, while Pomodoro is a time management technique that breaks down work
            into 25-minute blocks,
            interspersed with 5-minute breaks.</p>
         <h4 class="titleP">Stopwatch</h4>
         <p>Stopwatch can be used to measure the time you spend on different tasks.
            This can be helpful for identifying areas where you are wasting time and making
            adjustments to improve your productivity. For example, if you notice that you are
            spending too much time browsing the internet, you can use the stopwatch to set a time
            limit for that activity.</p>
         <p>Stopwatch can also be used to create a study or work schedule. For example,
            if you need to study for an exam, you can use the stopwatch to set a study schedule
            of 2 hours per day. This will help you stay on track and avoid procrastination.</p>
         <h4 class="titleP">Pomodoro</h4>
         <p>Pomodoro is a time management technique that breaks down work into 25-minute blocks, 
            interspersed with 5-minute breaks. This technique is based on the idea that the brain 
            is able to focus for relatively short periods of time. When you work on a 
            task for 25 minutes, your brain is focused and producing its best work. 
            However, after 25 minutes, your brain starts to get tired and your productivity 
            starts to decline. That's where the 5-minute break comes in. The break gives your 
            brain a chance to rest and recharge. After 5 minutes, you are ready to start a 
            new 25-minute block of work.</p>
         <p>Pomodoro is a very effective technique for improving focus and productivity. 
            It is simple to use and can be adapted to any type of work. 
            If you are looking for a way to improve your performance in school or at work, 
            Pomodoro is a great option.</p>
